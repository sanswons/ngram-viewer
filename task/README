* Minimal Google nGram viewer
=============================

[1] Look at Google ngram viewer, specifically https://goo.gl/7feVzf

    This takes 3 ngrams:2 2-grams and 1 1-gram and gives a distribution of occurrences
    of those in English language books over 200 years.

    OR

    here's another very cool one: https://goo.gl/NmPrrt

    Here's the assignment:

    There are per-year directories in this folder with books in them ...
    2012 through 2016

    Your task is to write a program that takes this data and exposes an
    ngram viewer webpage when run locally in that directory:

    test/ngram_viewer

    you can use whatever language you want for this.
    I DO NOT expect the same level of fancy visualizations, but extra points
    for that.

    Support 1-grams through 5-grams.


[2] Account for spelling mistakes in the input ngram queries

[3] Add support for suggesting (and including) synonyms for the key words
    (entities, nouns/verbs, etc) in the input ngrams
